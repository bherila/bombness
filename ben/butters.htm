    </table><p>Some letters I have received... </p>
          <p>By this Friday, 2/11, the Latin Club will need to know who is attending the Toga Party and Julius Caesar. <br>
              <br>
        Julius Caesar is a Broadway play with Denzel Washington playing Brutus. We will be going in the evening on the Wednesday before Easter break. The date is March 23. It will cost 25 dollars. <br>
        <br>
        We need to know who is interested in the Toga Party because the type of events we run depend on the number of people attending. <br>
        <br>
        I repeat: You MUST respond by emailing one of the officers or me (sasdf@yahoo.com), or posting in one of the discussions on the class fusion website. If there are any questions, do not hesitate to ask any of the officers. Their contact information is under contact information on the class fusion site. <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely, <br>
        <br>
        Andrew </p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Gentlemen, <br>
To increase security, effective tomorrow, mandatory network password changes will be enforced. Details below…. </p>
          <p><strong>Key points: </strong><br>
              <strong>-Passwords will expire every 90 days. You will be prompted to change your password at this time. </strong><br>
              <strong>-Passwords must be a minimum of 6 characters (not 5). </strong><br>
              <strong>-Don't use anything that would be to easy to guess, a combination of letters and numbers or other special characters is good. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>-This <em> only </em> affects your windows network password, not class web sites, turnitin, etc. </strong><br>
              <strong>-If you need to change your password at any time... login|press Ctrl-Alt-Delete at the same time|click change password. </strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>Please reply or stop in if you have any questions. Thanks for your cooperation. </p></td>
